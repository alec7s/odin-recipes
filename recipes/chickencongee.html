    <h1>Chicken Congee</h1>
    <img alt="An ornate bowl of chicken congee" href='../images/chickencongee.jpg'>
    <p>Chicken congee is an East Asian dish that is one of the most commonly consumed foods in the world. Congee requires few ingredients or steps to cook, so it's no wonder that it's such a popular dish.</p>
    <p>Lately, I have enjoyed eating congee for breakfast each day. I frequently try adding different ingredients for new flavor combinations, and I recommend that you do the same!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup white rice</li>
        <li>2.5 quarts chicken stock</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse and drain the rice.</li>
        <li>Put the rice in a pot with the chicken stock and bring to boil. Give the rice a good stir, scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking, then lower the heat and half-cover the pan. Simmer gently for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, stirring every 15 minutes, until the grains have burst open and you have a thick congee. Keep an eye on the pot to make sure the rice doesnâ€™t stick to the bottom. Toward the end of cooking, when the stock has become integrated with the rice and is the consistency of oatmeal, season lightly with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve the congee with any other ingredients that you'd like or just eat it plain. I usually include crushed black pepper, sesame oil, and hot sauce.</li>
    </ol>
